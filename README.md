# dice-fairness

The code in this repository is for testing whether a die is fair. <br /> <br />
Input the number of sides on your die (e.g. 6) as the variable 'n'. The code will output a value N that tells you how many rolls you need for the chi-square test to meet the set power & effect (power & effect are given in the code, but can be changed to your preference). <br /> <br />
Input your observations to the variable 'obs' (line 36) to replace the simulated observations. <br /> <br />
Output will be the result of the hypothesis test, where our null hypothesis is that the given die is fair and our alternative hypothesis is that it is not.
